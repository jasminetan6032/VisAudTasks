# VisAudTasks
#Description of tasks used for examining visual and auditory top-down and bottom-up attention processing in Tal Kenet's lab

Triggers for AudAtten: an auditory oddball paradigm

1 - 4 standard tones in attending ear

11-14 targets in attending ear

5-8 standard tones in other ear

25 - 28 novel sounds in other ear

35 - 38 target sound in other ear

so it would make sense if 

45 - 48 misophonic sound in other ear

event = 1: attended right, high tone, misophonic sound on left

event = 3: attended right, low tone, misophonic sound on left

event = 2: attended left, high tone, misophonic sound on right

event = 4: attended left, low tone, misophonic sound on right
